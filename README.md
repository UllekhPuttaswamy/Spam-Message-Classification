# Multi-Platform Spam Detection and Filtering System

The Multi-Platform Spam Detection and Filtering System is a comprehensive solution leveraging Python, NLP, Naive Bayes, TF-IDF Vectorizer, Flask, and Flutter. It seamlessly integrates into SMS applications to provide real-time spam detection via a web interface (Flask) and a mobile app (Flutter).

## Overview

This project aims to create a robust spam detection system that can differentiate between spam and legitimate messages with high accuracy. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes and TF-IDF Vectorizer, the system ensures a safer and more secure digital communication environment.

## Features

- **Real-time Spam Detection**: The system can detect spam messages in real-time.
- **Web Interface**: Built using Flask for easy accessibility and management.
- **Mobile App**: Developed using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF Vectorizer for accurate spam detection.
- **Platform Integration**: Easily integrates with existing SMS applications.



## Usage

### Web Interface

Access the Flask web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. From here, you can upload SMS datasets, train the model, and test spam detection.

### Mobile App

The Flutter mobile app provides an intuitive interface for real-time spam detection on the go. After setting up and running the app on your mobile device, you can use it to detect spam messages.

## Development Cycle

1. **Objective Definition**: Define the goals and scope of the spam detection system.
2. **SMS Dataset Collection**: Gather datasets containing spam and legitimate messages.
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning.
4. **Model Training and Fine-tuning**: Train the Naive Bayes model using TF-IDF Vectorizer and fine-tune for better performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Use evaluation metrics to select the most effective model.

## Evaluation Metrics

The system uses various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the spam detection model and ensure its effectiveness.
